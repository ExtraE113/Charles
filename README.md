# Charles

Charles is a Reddit bot that finds Amazon links and converts them to amazon smile links.
~~It also tracks these links using bit.ly to measure its impact.~~ It doesn't track links because Reddit
places link shorteners in the spam filter.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the requirements.
